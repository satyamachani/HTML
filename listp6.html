This topic describes the internal liks.
</p>
<p>
Internal links refers to the link between sections of a document.
When used to create links,
<a>tag must include text.
</p>
<p>
The name attribute used in the anchor tag identifies a section of a tag.   When
<a>
tags are used merely to identify a section of a document, text is not necessary.
</p>
<p>
<a name="SecondHeading">Second Topic</a>
</p>
<p>
User then can access this section via a link from within the document.   There
is no need to include text between the tags, because this text is not
highlighted and cannot be used to jump to another document or section of a document.
</p>
<p>
When a browser loads a URL with a # symbol, it looks for the section of the document with an anchor tag matching the name after the # symbol.
</p>
<p>
<a name="ThirdHeading">Third Topic</a>
</p>
<p>
The browser then displays the loaded page, with the beginning of the named 
section at the top of the screen.   This is because the tag is being used only
to mark a section of a document for later use in a link to another document.
