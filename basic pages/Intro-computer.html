<p><b>
<u>COMPUTER</u> <U>ABBRIVATION</U>: Common Oriented Machine Used For Technical 
		      Execution Research.

The word COMPUTER comes from `COMPUTE'.Which means Calculate.

<u>Defination</u>: Computer is a High-Speed Electronic machine which takes data from user,
	    and calculating  inside the electrical circutes and gives the output
	    in a required format.It performs Arithmetic and Logical Operations.

<u>Characteristic</u>: (i) It performs complex and reputive calculation rapidly and accurately 
		(ii) It stores large amount of data.
		(iii) It can draw and print graphs.
		(iV) It is used in almost all fields such as Banking a/c's,Railway Reservations,
		     Post offices,Bus Reservations,Airlines,Telephone,Electricity,& etc.,
		(V) Today computer is the backbone of industry.It provides the benifits.

<u>History of Computer's</u>: `Mr.Charles Babbage' is the father of computers. During 19th 
			century "Charles Babbage" developed a machine in 1852 called 'DIFFERENCE 
			ENGINE' through which we can Input data store Information perform
			arthematic calculations and print the defination. He also designed a 
			machine called 'ANATICAL ENGINE' in 1833.Taking this device the
			modern computer is developed.

	The first mechanical calculator performing arthematic operations was invented by 
	`Blaise Pascal' in 1642.it consists gears and wheels for performing the calculation.This 
	machine perform only two operations i.e., Add & Sub.He used it to assists his father,who 
	was a Tax collector,in adding and substracting numbers.

`<u>ASCII</u>' American Standard Code for Information Interchanged.

`<u>ENIAC</u>' Electronic Numeric Integrator and Calculator Is the first electronic machine
	  introduced in 1946 by J.Presper Eckert and John W.Mauchly Proffesors at Moore School of 
	  University of Pennsylvania and was called <u>ENIAC</u>. This computer was built to help 
	  U.S.Army to prepare Artillery Trajectory tables.There were 6000 switches which set to 
	  solve problems manually.It was a large machine(30 ft. X 50 ft) containing 18,000vaccum
	  tubes,70,000 resisters, 10,000 capacitors and had a small memory for storing data.It 
	  could process 300 calculation per second. 
	
`<u>BINAC</u>'(Binary Automatic Computer) was designed in 1949 and could receive data from a 
	typewriter,keyboard or from a magnetic tape.

`<u>UNIVAC</u>'(Universal Automatic Computer)made in 1951 used 1200 foot reels of metal tapes to
 	record data for processing.
`<u>IBM</u>' International Business Machines.

<b><U>GENERATION</u></b>: Generation means improvement in the computer technology.Generation are mainly 
	    divided into 5 types.

(1) First Generation: 1950's In this genaration computer are developed with Vaccum tubes.This 
	computer are very large in size with slow operating speed. 
(2) Second Generation: 1960's Inthis generation computers are developed with transistors with
	the replacement of Vaccum Tubes.
(3) Third Generation: 1970's Inthis generation IntelCorporations introduced IC Chips With the 
	Replacement of Resisters. (Integrated Circuits)
(4) Fourth Generation: 1980's Inthis generation computer are developed by the replacement of IC
	chips with LSIC chips.
(5) Fifth Generation: 1990's Inthis generation computer are developed by the replacement of LSIC
	with VLSIC chips. This computer are very small in size can store more information than 
	the previous generation with high operating speed and computing capacity.



<center><u><b>COMPUTER LANGUAGES</B></U></CENTER>
1. Declarative Language: It is just like a english language. This process highest level in 
			 computer with other languages.This languages are generally used as a 
			 command language.
2. Programing Language: It is a high level language.It is generally used as a programing purpose.
			so that programes may be easily transferd with out any substantial 
			revision. Ex: Basic, Cobal, C++, Etc.
3. Assembly Language: It is a low level language symbolic programe.The assembly language are miss 
		      in depended i.e., each computer has it's own decission.
4. Low Level Language: The machine Language are misin depended language and each computer has 
		     it's own decission to complete a set of command in decission under standable
		     to used directly. This execution is called machine language or L L Language.

Compilers:Itis used to highlevel language into machine language called a source code.Ex:Pascal,c.
Assembly: It used to convert assembly language into machine language.
Interpreter: They Translate share programe into object programe. It is widely used on micro 
computers and interactive time sharing system.Ex: Languages Like Basic, Packages Like Dbase.


<center><b><u>Types Of Computer</u></b></center>
(1) ANALAP: This computer operate on the principal of creating physical ANALAP Mahthematical
 	problem which involves measurment of certain physical paramids i.e.,Pressure,Temperature, 
	Heat, Speed Etc.The best example of ANALAP Computer is speedo meter of vehical.

(2) DIGITAL: The digital computer is a name suggest work with digit's.It is counting device all 
	expression and information is translated into Binary system(0 to1 ) with in the computer
	it can work with accurate results.

(3) HYBRID: It is the combination of ANALAP Computer and DIGITAL Computer's which can work with
	high rate of speed and very large storage of capacity live this computer can offer only
	few departments.

<U><I>Type of Digital Computer</i></U>
It is mainly divided into 4 types. They are (i) Mini (ii) Main (iii) Micro (iV) Super Computer

(i)Mini Computer: It's appearence smaller than the mainframe computer nearly 100 members can do
		  the programme ata time. It is also used as dedicated computers and performs 
		  function controlling score board,collecting laboratory data.The processing
		  speed are much better than micro computers.
		  
(ii)Main Computer: It has a very high rate of speed and very large storage capacity. Nearly 500
		   members can do the pragramme at a time. So,it is called `Multiuser System'.
		   Ability to handle large computer application like Airline Reservation.

(iii)Micro Computer: These are the smallest and least expensive.It is Operated by a single person 
		     and it's cost is low.They are also known as "Lap top computer","Personal 
		     computers"(PC's) Some examples of micro-computer are IBM PC, PC-XT, PC-AT.

(iV)Super Computer: SuperComputers are very huge Primary memory and the most advanced processing
		    capabilities.The speed of this computer is measured with MOPS(Millions of
		    Operations Per Second). These computers are used in Scientific and 
		    Technological Research and Weather Forecasting Systems.

<u><b>Booting</b></u>: The Process to change the computer OFF to ON position is called Booting.
<b><u><center>
SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE</u></b></center> 
<u>
SOFTWARE</u>: A set of programes that instructs the operation of the hardware components of a
	 computer system is called SOFTWARE.Computer Software is like Human mind Which we 
	 can't see but its effect can be felt. It is divided in to two types. They are
	 (i) Application Software and (ii) System Software.

<tt>(i)Application Software</tt>: It is a set of one or more programes design to operation for a specific
			 application.It used for obtaining pay slips,mark list of candidates etc.

(ii)System Software: It is to controll off processing activities and makes share that reasons 
		    power of the computer is called System Software.Ex:(1)Running of the other
		    software.(2)Supporting the development of the other software.
<em>
HUMAN WARE: The person related to the computer field is called HumanWare.</em>

<u>
HARDWARE</u>: Hardware denotes the CPU, Monitor, Disk and other peripherals. Computer Hardware 
	  cannot function without Software. Software tells the Hardware what to do and how 
	  to do,Like Human mind tells the body to Walk, Run, Sit, Etc.
